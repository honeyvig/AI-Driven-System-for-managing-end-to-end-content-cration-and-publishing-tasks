Based on successful collaboration, we may extend the scope of work to include additional AI Agent development tasks for marketing and analytics automation.

Ideal Candidate Requirements:

+ Proven experience in AI Agent development and automation.
+ Proficiency in Google scraping and data analysis tools.
+ Strong skills in AI content creation tools (e.g., GPT-based systems, AI image generators).
+ Familiarity with WordPress for content publishing.
+ Knowledge of SEO best practices and marketing workflows is a plus.
======================
To create an AI-driven system that handles end-to-end content creation and publishing tasks, we can break it down into several key components, which align with the tasks mentioned: Google Scraping, Website Analysis, Content Writing, Image Design, and Article Compilation/Publishing to WordPress. This solution would involve integrating several tools, libraries, and APIs, such as:

    Google Scraping: Using tools like Google Custom Search API or scraping libraries.
    Website Analysis: Using BeautifulSoup for web scraping or integrating AI models for content analysis.
    Content Writing: Using GPT-based language models (e.g., OpenAI GPT).
    Image Design: Using an image generation API (e.g., DALL·E or any other generative image model).
    Article Compilation and Publishing: Using the python-wordpress-xmlrpc library to interact with WordPress.

Requirements:

    Libraries: We will use requests, BeautifulSoup, openai, Pillow, python-wordpress-xmlrpc, and others.
    APIs: Google Search API (for scraping), OpenAI GPT (for content writing), image generation tools (like OpenAI's DALL·E or similar), and WordPress API (for publishing).
    Tools: Basic text processing and content management libraries.

Installation:

pip install openai requests beautifulsoup4 pillow python-wordpress-xmlrpc

Code for AI-Driven Content Creation System:

import openai
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO
from wordpress_xmlrpc import Client
from wordpress_xmlrpc.methods.posts import NewPost
from wordpress_xmlrpc.methods.users import GetUserInfo

# Initialize OpenAI API key
openai.api_key = 'your-openai-api-key-here'

# WordPress Site details
wp_url = 'http://your-wordpress-site/xmlrpc.php'
wp_username = 'your_username'
wp_password = 'your_password'

# Google Scraping: Using Google's Custom Search API
def google_scraping(query, num_results=10):
    api_key = 'your-google-api-key'
    cse_id = 'your-custom-search-engine-id'
    
    url = f'https://www.googleapis.com/customsearch/v1?q={query}&key={api_key}&cx={cse_id}'
    response = requests.get(url)
    results = response.json()
    
    links = []
    for item in results.get('items', []):
        links.append(item['link'])
    
    return links[:num_results]

# Website Analysis: Extract text content from the website
def analyze_website(url):
    response = requests.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
    
    # Extract all paragraphs
    paragraphs = soup.find_all('p')
    content = " ".join([p.get_text() for p in paragraphs])
    
    return content

# Content Writing: Using OpenAI GPT to generate SEO-optimized articles
def generate_article(content_plan):
    prompt = f"Write a high-quality SEO-optimized article based on the following content plan:\n{content_plan}\nMake it engaging and informative."
    
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003",
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=2000
    )
    
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

# Image Design: Using DALL·E or similar API to generate an image based on the article
def generate_image_from_text(description):
    url = "https://api.openai.com/v1/images/generations"
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {openai.api_key}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
    }
    data = {
        "model": "image-alpha-001",
        "prompt": description,
        "n": 1,
        "size": "1024x1024"
    }
    
    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)
    image_url = response.json()['data'][0]['url']
    image_response = requests.get(image_url)
    img = Image.open(BytesIO(image_response.content))
    
    # Save the image (or upload it to your server if needed)
    img.save("generated_image.jpg")

    return "generated_image.jpg"  # Return the file path to the image

# Article Compilation and Publishing to WordPress
def publish_to_wordpress(title, content, image_path):
    client = Client(wp_url, wp_username, wp_password)
    
    # Create a new post
    post = NewPost()
    post.title = title
    post.content = content
    
    # Attach image (you can upload the image to WordPress media library)
    with open(image_path, 'rb') as img:
        img_data = img.read()
        media = client.call(media.UploadFile({'name': 'generated_image.jpg', 'type': 'image/jpeg', 'bits': img_data}))
        post.thumbnail = media.id
    
    # Publish the post
    post.post_status = 'draft'  # Or 'publish' if you want it to go live immediately
    post_id = client.call(NewPost(post))
    
    return post_id

# Main function that orchestrates the entire process
def main():
    # Step 1: Google Scraping - get the URLs from Google Search
    query = "Artificial Intelligence in 2024"
    search_results = google_scraping(query)
    
    # Step 2: Analyze one of the selected websites for content generation
    website_content = analyze_website(search_results[0])
    
    # Step 3: Generate Content Plan - Here we are assuming a simplified content plan
    content_plan = "Introduction to AI, Applications of AI, Future of AI, Conclusion"
    
    # Step 4: Generate Article using OpenAI GPT
    article = generate_article(content_plan)
    
    # Step 5: Generate Image using AI
    image_path = generate_image_from_text("A futuristic depiction of Artificial Intelligence")
    
    # Step 6: Compile the Article and Publish to WordPress
    title = "The Future of Artificial Intelligence in 2024"
    post_id = publish_to_wordpress(title, article, image_path)
    
    print(f"Article published successfully with Post ID: {post_id}")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

Key Components:

    Google Scraping:
        Using Google's Custom Search API, we scrape a list of URLs based on the provided query.
        The google_scraping function fetches links related to the topic.

    Website Analysis:
        The analyze_website function takes a URL and scrapes the website content using BeautifulSoup.
        This content will help generate a plan for the article.

    Content Writing:
        The generate_article function uses OpenAI GPT to write an article based on the content plan.

    Image Design:
        The generate_image_from_text function uses OpenAI's DALL·E (or similar tools) to generate an image based on the article's topic.
        The image is then saved and can be included in the article.

    Article Compilation and Publishing:
        The publish_to_wordpress function compiles the article, including the text and image, and publishes it as a draft (or published) to a WordPress site using the python-wordpress-xmlrpc library.

Workflow:

    Scraping: Collect data from Google search results.
    Website Analysis: Analyze content from the scraped websites.
    Article Writing: Generate SEO-optimized content using GPT.
    Image Generation: Use AI to generate a relevant image.
    Publishing: Compile the article and publish it to WordPress with media.

Important Notes:

    OpenAI API Key: You need an OpenAI API key to access GPT and DALL·E for text and image generation.
    WordPress Integration: The python-wordpress-xmlrpc library interacts with WordPress using XML-RPC. Ensure that XML-RPC is enabled on your WordPress instance.
    Google Custom Search: You need a Google API key and custom search engine ID for scraping.

Conclusion:

This code provides a comprehensive starting point for building an AI-driven content creation system that automates web scraping, content generation, image design, and article publishing to WordPress. Depending on the complexity of the content, further improvements (like more sophisticated AI models, error handling, and scheduling posts) could be added.
